### Stopwatch
Stopwatch is a simple (linux only) stopwatch utility for those not satisfied with `time sleep 1d`. It is currently 100ms accurate.

##### Use
`stopwatch` starts a stopwatch and displays the elapsed time.   
For lap functionality, press the `"enter"/"return"` key.   
Send any signal to stop (`Ctrl+C` is the simplest)
